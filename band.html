    <dt>I'm The Problem</dt>
    <dd>I really liked this album and I liked the variety of songs. I also like how a lot of the songs told a story.</dd>

    <dt>One Thing At A Time</dt>
    <dd>This was a very long album with 36 songs and I really enjoy each one of them. This is my favorite Morgan Wallen album.</dd>

    <dt>Dangerous: The Double Album</dt>
    <dd>I thought it was really cool that this was a double album, so there was a disk 1 and a disk 2. I loved all the songs.</dd>
